Releaseter is a GitHub Action that helps users generate release drafts from the latest release to the latest pull request. This tool is inspired by the configuration file of [release-drafter/release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter).

## Usage

To use Releaseter, simply add it as a step in your GitHub Action workflow:

```yaml
name: example
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: JZGoopi/releaseter@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

When using Releaseter, make sure to pass in the `github-token` and grant it `pull-requests` and `contents` write permissions.

## Customization

Releaseter can be customized by creating a configuration file. By default, Releaseter will look for a `.github/releaseter.yml` file for configuration. To specify a different file path, use the `config-path` input:

```yaml
      - uses: JZGoopi/releaseter@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          config-path: 'apple/banana.yml'
```

This will cause Releaseter to look for a configuration file at `.github/apple/banana.yml`.

### Configuration File Template

The following is an example configuration file for Releaseter:

```yaml
name-template: '{{ $TIME_WORKFLOW }}'

tag-template: 'v{{ $VERSION_NEXT_PATCH }}'
tag-preRelease: ""
tag-build: ""

categories:
  - title: 'üöÄ Features'
    labels:
      - 'feature'
      - 'feat'
  - title: 'üêõ Bug Fixes'
    labels:
      - 'fix'
      - 'bugfix'
      - 'bug'

category-other:
  show: true
  title: 'OTHERRR'

clear-history-draft: true

time-format: '06/01/02 15:04:05'
time-location: 'Asia/Taipei'
```

The `name-template` is the template for the release title. It supports several placeholders and defaults to `{{ $TIME_WORKFLOW }}`.

The `tag-template` is the template for the tag. It also supports several placeholders and defaults to `v{{ $VERSION_NEXT_PATCH }}`.

Both `name-template` and `tag-template` support the following placeholders:

- `{{ $VERSION_NEXT_MAJOR }}`: the next major version
- `{{ $VERSION_NEXT_MINOR }}`: the next minor version
- `{{ $VERSION_NEXT_PATCH }}`: the next patch version
- `{{ $TIME_WORKFLOW }}`: the time when the workflow is run
- `{{ $EMPTY }}`: an empty string
- The version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as defined by GitHub, and Releaseter will use the latest tag that matches the `tag-template` as a baseline.

`tag-preRelease` and `tag-build` are pre-release and build tags for [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), respectively. They default to an empty string.

`categories` is an array of categories, each with a title and a list of labels. If a pull request's labels match any of the specified labels, its title will be added to the corresponding category. The format will be:

```
### Category Title
---
- PR1
- PR2
```

`category-other` controls whether to include pull requests that do not match any of the specified labels. It has two keys:

- `show`: A boolean value that determines whether to include unmatched pull requests. The default value is `false`.
- `title`: The title for the section that includes unmatched pull requests. The default value is `'OTHER'`.

`clear-history-draft` controls whether to clear existing drafts. It defaults to `false`.

`time-format` is the format for the time. It uses Golang's placeholder syntax and defaults to `'060102 15:04:05'`. The available placeholders are:

- Year:
  - `2006`: four-digit year
  - `06`: two-digit year
- Month:
  - `1` or `01`: numeric month
  - `Jan`: abbreviated month name
- Day: `2` or `02`
- Hour:
  - `3`: 12-hour clock hour
  - `15`: 24-hour clock hour
- Minute: `4` or `04`
- Second:
  - `5` or `05`
  - `5.000000`: decimal fraction of a second
- Timezone:
  - `MST`: Mountain Standard Time
  - `UTC`: Coordinated Universal Time
  - `EST`: Eastern Standard Time
  - `CST`: Central Standard Time
  - `PST`: Pacific Standard Time
  - `-0700`: numeric timezone offset from UTC (e.g. -7 hours)
  - `-07:00`: numeric timezone offset from UTC with colon separator (e.g. -7:00)
- Weekday:
  - `Mon`: abbreviated weekday name
  - `Monday`: full weekday name
- AM/PM:
  - `PM`: uppercase AM/PM
  - `pm`: lowercase AM/PM

You can use these placeholders to format the time in the way that you prefer. For example, if you want to include the abbreviated weekday name and the timezone offset, you can use the following format:

```yaml
time-format: 'Mon, Jan 02 2006 15:04:05 -0700'
```

This will produce a time string like `Fri, May 07 2023 10:30:00 -0700`, where `Fri` is the abbreviated weekday name, `May 07 2023` is the date, `10:30:00` is the time, and `-0700` is the timezone offset.


`time-location` Controls the timezone used for timestamps. The value must be a valid name from the IANA Time Zone database. The default value is `'Asia/Taipei'`.

## Conclusion

Releaseter is a helpful tool for generating release drafts from the latest release to the latest pull request. With its customizable configuration options, you can tailor it to your specific needs.
